This initiative is a portable version of LEGO Island (Version 1.1, English) based on the [decompilation project](https://github.com/isledecomp/isle). Our primary goal is to transform the codebase to achieve platform independence, thereby enhancing compatibility across various systems while preserving the original game's experience as faithfully as possible.

Please note: this project is dedicated to achieving platform independence without altering the core gameplay, adding new features, enhancing visual quality, or rewriting code for improvement's sake. While those are worthwhile objectives, they are not within the scope of this project.

### Library substitutions

To achieve our goal of platform independence, we need to replace any Windows-only libraries with platform-independent alternatives. This ensures that our codebase remains versatile and compatible across various systems. The following table serves as an overview of major libraries / subsystems and their chosen replacements. For any significant changes or additions, it's recommended to discuss them with the team on the Matrix chat first to ensure consistency and alignment with our project's objectives.

## Building

This project uses the [CMake](https://cmake.org/) build system, which allows for a high degree of versatility regarding compilers and development environments. Please refer to the [GitHub action](/.github/workflows//ci.yml) for guidance.

## Usage

**An existing copy of LEGO Island is required to use this project.**

As it stands, the builds provided in the Releases tab are for developers; as such, they may not work properly for end-users. Work is currently ongoing to create workable release builds ready for gameplay and general use by end-users. If you are technically inclined, you may find it easiest to compile the project yourself to get it running at this current point in time.
